# Data Flows
Data flow is the first step in integrating various data sources to SkyPoint cloud platform to create customer/patient segmentation, profiles, Audiences and Metrics. This can be accomplished using prebuilt or custom build connectors. The platform already supports 200+ connectors that allows ingestion of data from different data sources with more under various stages of development.
The data connectors move data from a selected data source to Skypoint Customer 360 or Patient 360 through a series of filtering, formatting, and transformation process which is aligned to Common Data model (CDM) and FHIR standards respectively

## Following functions performed by connector includes:
-	Understanding the data source schema, attributes
-	Data transformation
-	Data ingestion
-	Data extraction

### Status
After the connection is established and the run operation has also been performed, as a user, you need to know whether everything was successfully processed or not. For that, our platform provides a status column where you can check whether the data was imported correctly or not. The green tick under the status section indicates that the data has been imported and the connection has been established successfully.
